# todoapplicationbackend
A "To-Do Application Backend" refers to the server-side infrastructure that handles the logic, data storage, and processing for a to-do list application. It typically includes the implementation of a RESTful Web API, which enables communication between the client and the server. This API facilitates the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of tasks, allowing users to interact with their to-do lists efficiently. The backend manages the core functionality of the application, ensuring data is stored, retrieved, and modified correctly while maintaining a smooth user experience.
